                One of India's most famous historical attractions is the Taj Mahal, which is situated in Agra. One of the Seven Wonders of the World and a symbol of love, the Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in honor of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The White Marble Mahal is renowned for its exquisite gardens, intricate marble inlay work, and intricate architecture.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-4 me-4">
                The best times to see the Taj Mahal's magnificence are at sunrise or sunset, when the light gives the marble building a mysterious sheen. Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan's recollections are beautifully embellished with priceless stones inside the Taj Mahal, showcasing the artistry of the time. The symmetrical design of the surrounding gardens and the reflected Yamuna River lend an air of ethereal beauty to the monument.

            <p class=" mt-3 ms-4 me-4" >
                The fort was built as a palace by fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, when he shifted his capital from Agra to Delhi in 1638. The capital, known as Shahjahanabad, was where Old Delhi is today. Much of the development took place around Chandni Chowk, the chaotic and crumbling market area adjoining the Red Fort.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-4 me-4">
                The Mughals occupied the fort for almost 200 years, until it was lost to the British in 1857. When India obtained Independence on August 15, 1947, the first Prime Minister of India (Jawahar Lal Nehru) unfurled the Indian flag from the fort's ramparts. This practice still continues every Independence Day, when India's Prime Minister hoists the Indian flag and gives a speech there.

                Regarded as the precursor to the iconic Taj Mahal, Humayun's Tomb stands as a glorious testament to Mughal architecture. Commissioned by Humayun's wife, Empress Bega Begum, in 1570, the tomb is set amidst sprawling gardens, divided by water channels. It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent and inspired several subsequent architectural wonders.

            <p class="ms-4 me-4">
                The structure of Humayun's tomb is a mix of Islamic and Persian architecture with smatterings of Indian elegance too. Six-sided stars that embellish the main opening on the west, are also seen on the main tomb structure, though it has been used as a patterned galactic symbol. The mosque also has the tomb of Emperor's beloved barber. The tomb built of debris of granite and red sandstone uses white marble as a covering material. It has main features of Indian - Islamic architecture like jaalis, door frames and chhajja.

                One of the most famous Gurudwara in the entire world, Sri Harmandir Sahib is one of the important spiritual places in India. While it has been around for a long while, it was rebuilt with pure gold and marble in 1830 by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Located in the heart of Amritsar, it is visited by more than a hundred thousand pilgrims every day. It is considered one of the top five historical monuments of India and a must-visit attraction for those who are seeking the best of all in India.

                The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and the 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s, the gurdwara became a centre of conflict between the Indian government and a radical movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, leading to the deaths of thousands of soldiers, militants and civilians, as well as causing significant damage to the gurdwara and the destruction of the nearby Akal Takht.

                The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Rajpath (officially called Kartavya path) on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi. It stands as a memorial to 74,187 soldiers of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.

                The Jantar Mantar is a collection of 19 astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of Jaipur, Rajasthan. The monument was completed in 1734. It features the world's largest stone sundial. It is near City Palace and Hawa Mahal. The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy which was shared by many civilizations.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-4 me-4">
                The monument features instruments operating in each of the three main classical celestial coordinate systems: the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system, and the ecliptic system. The Kanmala Yantraprakara is one that works in two systems and allows transformation of the coordinates directly from one system to the other. It has the biggest sundial in the world.The monument was damaged in the 19th century. Early restoration work was undertaken under the supervision of Major Arthur Garrett, a keen amateur astronomer, during his appointment as Assistant State Engineer for the Jaipur District.

                The Charminar (lit.'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr, as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.

                The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River. To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid. The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chār and minar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches
